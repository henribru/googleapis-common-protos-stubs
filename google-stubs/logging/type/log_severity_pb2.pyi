# The severity of the event described in a log entry, expressed as one of the
# standard severity levels listed below.  For your reference, the levels are
# assigned the listed numeric values. The effect of using numeric values other
# than those listed is undefined.
#
# You can filter for log entries by severity.  For example, the following
# filter expression will match log entries with severities `INFO`, `NOTICE`,
# and `WARNING`:
#
#     severity > DEBUG AND severity <= WARNING
#
# If you are writing log entries, you should map other severity encodings to
# one of these standard levels. For example, you might map all of Java's FINE,
# FINER, and FINEST levels to `LogSeverity.DEBUG`. You can preserve the
# original severity level in the log entry payload if you wish.
