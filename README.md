# Type stubs for googleapis-common-protos
[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/googleapis-common-protos-stubs.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/googleapis-common-protos-stubs)

This package provides type stubs for the [googleapis-common-protos](https://pypi.org/project/googleapis-common-protos/) package.

**This is in no way affiliated with Google.**

The stubs were created automatically by [mypy-protobuf](https://github.com/dropbox/mypy-protobuf).

Note that if you're using Mypy you need to use the `--namespace-packages` option as `google` and some of its subpackages are namespace packages.

## Installation
```shell script
$ pip install googleapis-common-protos-stubs
```
